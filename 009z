     * Too much code is bad
       * More code requires more maintenance
     * Tests are code
       * They add to the maintenance problem
     * Tests should be mostly data
       * Much easier to maintain
     * TestML is mostly data
       * Makes testing not suck

     * Code should be mostly data too
       * But that's a whole 'nother talk
