This site is starting out as a copy of the fantastic <a href="http://coffeescript.org">CoffeeScript</a> web site. Currently the only part of interest is the <a href="/playground/">TestML Playground</a> nav link above.

**TestML is data driven software testing language that works with all popular
programming languages and their favorite test frameworks.** You write up your
inputs and expected outputs and a simple assertion statement of how to get from
one to the other. TestML takes care of the rest, giving you lots of testing
functionality for the minimum input.
